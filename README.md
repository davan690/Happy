# Happy Project 
## Introduction
The World Happiness Report is an annual publication of the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network which contains rankings of national happiness and analysis of the data from various perspectives.&mdash; [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Happiness_Report#cite_note-1)

The project is inspired by this report. During exploring the original dataset of the Happiness Report, we found that Latino countries are generally happy.

Considering their relatively low GDP level, their level of happiness is very outstanding.

    <a href="https://plot.ly/~wyr211/22/?share_key=wuq0PX2WqUxxQFmMjSzjOP" target="_blank" title="plot from API (10)" style="display: block; text-align: center;"><img src="https://plot.ly/~wyr211/22.png?share_key=wuq0PX2WqUxxQFmMjSzjOP" alt="plot from API (10)" style="max-width: 100%;width: 100%;"  width="80%" onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='https://plot.ly/404.png';" /></a>
    
</div>


So we want to give this unusual happiness some possible explanations. We tried the theory of religion, social support and generic gift by integrating external datasets to do further analysis.
