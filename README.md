# Happy Project 
## Introduction
The World Happiness Report is an annual publication of the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network which contains rankings of national happiness and analysis of the data from various perspectives.&mdash; [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Happiness_Report#cite_note-1)

The project is inspired by this report. During exploring the original dataset of the Happiness Report, we found that Latino countries are outstandingly happier comparing with other countries with similar level of wealthness.

So we want to give this unusual happiness some possible explanations. First we tried the theory of religion. Can religion boost Latin people's feeling of happiness? As per our dataset, we don't find a clear relation between happiness and region. Though Latino countries do have higher ratio of religous people, religions might not be the main source of their happiness.
